1. R2_and_wilcox_test_statistics.xlsx
   
This spreadsheet includes the imputation accuracy represented by different types of R2 (squared correlation) (e.g. true R2, adjusted true R2, estimated R2) for each imputation reference panel at each bin of minor allele frequency (MAF) in the Xu et al. 2024 paper (see below for citation). In addition, this spreadsheet includes pairwise comparison of imputation accuracy (i.e., measured by true R2, adjusted true R2, and/or estimated R2) across different imputation panels at each MAF bin, with significance tested by Wilcoxon rank-sum test (p-values are shown).
